## About This Dataset

### Context
The reduction of child mortality is a cornerstone of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and serves as a key indicator of global human progress. By 2030, the UN aims to eliminate preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years old, striving for underâ€‘5 mortality rates of at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.

In tandem, maternal mortality remains a critical concern, with an estimated 295,000 deaths occurring during and after pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). These fatalities, 94% of which happen in low-resource settings, are largely preventable with timely medical interventions.

Cardiotocograms (CTGs) offer a cost-effective and straightforward method for assessing fetal health, empowering healthcare professionals to take timely action and mitigate risks associated with child and maternal mortality. CTG equipment functions by emitting ultrasound pulses and analyzing the responses to provide insights into fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions, and related parameters.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Problem Definition
Clearly define the research objective: to classify fetal health into three categories (Normal, Suspect, Pathological) to enable proactive interventions.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Load and preview the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns, trends, and distributions.
- Identify potential outliers and anomalies in the dataset.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers if present.
- Normalize or standardize the dataset to ensure consistent scaling.
- Encode categorical variables (if any) for compatibility with machine learning models.
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Assess feature importance using statistical tests or domain knowledge.
- Generate additional features if required, such as polynomial or interaction terms.
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) if necessary to simplify the dataset while retaining critical information.

### 5. Model Selection and Training
- Experiment with various machine learning models, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM
  - Neural Networks for deep learning
- Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Use appropriate metrics to assess model performance:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC for multi-class evaluation
- Compare model performance to identify the best-suited algorithm for the classification task.

### 7. Deployment and Visualization
- Deploy the selected model in a test environment to assess real-world performance.
- Create interactive and informative visualizations of results, such as:
  - Feature importance charts
  - Class distribution plots
  - Confusion matrix heatmaps

### 8. Insights and Recommendations
- Summarize key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
- Provide actionable recommendations for healthcare professionals based on the model's predictions.
- Highlight limitations of the analysis and suggest areas for future research.
